# Introduction
- 2Ddemo.py: 
    - 2D image 3 joints
    - the first joint have rotation and transition
    - the second and third joints only can rotation
    
- 3Ddemo.py
    - 3D space with 7 joints
    - the root joint(wrist) has 6 degree of freedom, 3 for rotation and 3 for transition.
    - two joints(metacarpophalangeal joints) next to the root joints have 2 degree of freedom for rotation respectively.
    - other joints(distal interphalangeal joints) only has one degree of freedom for rotation
